    "At the start of the project I wanted to analysed industrial or manufacturing data as that was my background.  A dataset search on Kaggle led me to IoT manufacturing sensor data.  Unforturnately, these dataset are simulated dataset and I did not want to work on simulated data.  Then I stumbled upon defense manufacturer's dataset and thought it would be a good idea to study it to gain some insights into their geographical spread, market capitalisation, geopolitical affliation and correlations with global confilicts around the world."
